### Washington Alloy

#### Streamlining Inventory Management Process

Washington Alloy has +3000 unique inventory item across the nationwide warehouses. A variety of item selections is one of the most important competitive edges. And it's critical to always keep adequate stocking levels across all the warehouses. Acumatica ERP solution retains all of related datasets; however, data points were very spread out so I used Python and SQL, joining all required tables and clean/manipulate/transform them in order to improve data quality. 

Result
* Created a clear high-level visual dashboard that tracks stock levels and financial performance at multiple granularity levels (Customer, Inventory ID, Date, etc)
