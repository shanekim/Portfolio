### Washington Alloy

#### Product Recommendation Engine

Washington Alloy has +3000 unique inventory item across the nationwide warehouses. In order to help salesperson to pinpoint what other customers had similar purchase pattern and provide recommendations on products, I used Matrix Factorization model that learns latent features and interaction between customers and products. This way, recommendations are applicable to different individual customer.

#### Web Scraper for Marketing Campaign

Launching a new product always needs great marketing campaigns. First was a direct mail postcard marketing. In order to collect potential customers' geographical information such as address, phone number, etc, I built web scrapers that automatically type zipcode  hit search button, load a full page with infinite scroll, and create AWS RDS tables that are also stored in AWS DynamoDB.

#### Streamlining Inventory Management Process

A variety of item selections is one of the most important competitive edges. And it's critical to always keep adequate stocking levels across all the warehouses. Acumatica ERP solution retains all of related datasets; however, data points were very spread out so I used Python and SQL, joining all required tables and clean/manipulate/transform them in order to improve data quality. 

Result: Created a clear high-level visual dashboard that tracks stock levels and financial performance at multiple granularity levels (Customer, Inventory ID, Date, etc)
